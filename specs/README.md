# Builder Syndicate Specifications

The bulk of this is for historical record of the original specifications and intentions of this
project. 

The specs were generated in this order:

  - [Goose driven](./alpha-goose/)
    - `goose-gpt-5`
    - Created via an interactive goose session over several hours to refine the thoughts
  - [Claude driven](./alpha-claude/)
    - `claude-sonnet-4.5`
    - Aimed to be a refinement during a session with claude code (Sonnet 4.5)
  - [Amp driven](./alpha-amp/)
    - `claude-opus-4.5` + `GPT-5`
    - a series of sessions using multiple models to zero in on the final spec

At the point of this writing, `specs` points to the amp driven specifications.
